        <p>
          The Black Biomedical Research Movement was formed for the purpose of
          eliminating our nation's severe health disparity and increasing the
          pool of minority researchers funded by the National Institutes of
          Health.
        </p>

        <p>Our two-fold mission is:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            To improve health outcomes by aggressively raising health
            consciousness in Black Americans; and
          </li>
          <li>
            To increase African American involvement in all facets of National
            Institutes of Health (NIH) and similarly funded biomedical research
            projects affecting the health of Black peoples.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section>
        <div class="section-header">The Philosophy &ndash;</div>

        <p>
          BBRM takes a modern, multidisciplinary and proactive approach to
          solving the myriad health crises affecting the Black community. Our
          hallmark, and what sets BBRM apart from other organizations with
          similar goals, is our unique capacity to reach a wide cross-section of
          Black youth through a nontraditional approach to health education
          involving culturally relevant "edutainment".
        </p>

        <p>
          Our innovative marketing strategies are linked to popular,
          youth-oriented events such as professional sports, comedy, dance and
          music, including reggae, hip-hop and rhythm and blues. The BBRM
          Cultural Health Symposia are potent social catalysts for both personal
          and community health-enhancing changes in attitude and behavior. Our
          unique ethnically-appropriate health education strategies have a
          profound impact on transforming the health-related attitudes and
          practices of Black people. Our philosophy is that only by empowering
          cultural groups with concrete knowledge and effective tools for
          behavioral change that are relevant to their own lives will the huge
          ethnic and economic disparities in health in the United States
          disappear.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <div class="section-header">The Goals &ndash;</div>

        <p>The primary goals of the BBRM are to:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Improve health attitudes, knowledge, and behavior in African
            Americans, especially Black young adults, with area-specific designs
            to efficiently deliver relevant high-impacting health messages to
            the people in that area.
          </li>

          <li>
            Develop original and inspiring, culturally-relevant health education
            materials for people attending our health workshops, symposia, and
            tutorial programs.
          </li>

          <li>
            Increase the participation of Black people in biomedical research in
            the United States by recruiting top-level Black college students in
            the sciences, and procuring sufficient sources of funding for their
            graduate training in biomedical programs at major universities.
          </li>

          <li>
            Increase the participation of African Americans involved in all
            levels of biomedical research, including participation as research
            subjects and become advocates for more federal dollars for
            biomedical research.
          </li>
        </ul>
