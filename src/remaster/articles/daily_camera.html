        <section>
          <p>
            After being affiliated with the University of Colorado for nearly 10
            years, a Boulder-based group dedicated to public health and
            increasing the number of black biologists has cut ties with the
            school in an effort to enhance its fundraising efforts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Spokeswoman Elle Housman said the Black Biomedical Research Movement
            maintained its nonprofit status through the CU Foundation. Although
            the affiliation with the CU Foundation was helpful because it
            provided credibility to the organization, Housman said, it became
            difficult "cutting through the red tape" to raise money through the
            foundation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The nonprofit was created in 1997 as the community outreach
            component of a <br />$1.2 million, five-year grant from the National
            Institutes of Health. The grant was awarded to Patrick Allen, a
            post-doctoral researcher who came to CU in 1991 on a fellowship to
            study HIV through CU's molecular, cellular and developmental biology
            department.
          </p>
          <p>
            Allen founded the nonprofit after seeing the need to improve health
            education for blacks and realizing that only 2.8 percent of all
            biological scientists in the world <br />&mdash; and only 1 percent
            of U.S. biological scientists &mdash; were black.
          </p>
          <p>
            Housman said the organization aims to promote health, prevent
            disease and increase the number of black biomedical researchers. The
            group is officially defined as "an AIDS research, education and
            information nonprofit," she said.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to the challenges of raising money through the CU
            Foundation, the organization has found it increasingly difficult to
            secure government funding in recent years, Housman said.
          </p>
          <p>"AIDS has fallen out of the spotlight," she said.</p>
          <p>
            So the organization is trying to increase its funding efforts. One
            step was to retain a lawyer in New York to help the group
            re-establish its nonprofit status, independent of CU.
          </p>
          <p>
            Housman said she expects that status to be official within the next
            month, and "then we'll be able to function and write grants and take
            donations."
          </p>
          <p>
            A large part of the organization's recent activity involves
            outreach. Allen said he travels about once a month, speaking about
            health issues, sometimes with the help of black celebrities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Allen has collaborated with Evander Holyfield, Spike Lee, Jadakiss
            and comedian John Lassiter.
          </p>
          <p>
            The organization also sponsors a health symposium. In 2002, the
            symposium was held in Boulder and attracted about 1,500 people,
            Allen said.
          </p>
          <p>
            Housman said the Black Biomedical Research Movement plans to open
            its head&shy;quarters in New York, but Allen will remain in Boulder,
            operating a local branch.
          </p>
          <p>The organization estimates its membership at 5,000.</p>
