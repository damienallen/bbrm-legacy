						  <p><strong>By Robert Oyugi</strong></p>
						  <p>Dr Patrick Allen, a native of Jamaica-born in  the Warika Hilis area off Windward Road, Kingston, holds a  Undergraduate Degree from Springfield College B.S. in Biology and a  Post-Graduate Degree from the University of California Santa Cruz,  Ph.D. in Molecular Biology. Dr Allen is a professor and research  associate at the University of Colorado at Boulder and is one of the  country's leading AIDS/HIV researchers. Working since 1995 as principal  investigator on a $1.2 million National Institutes of Health study,  Allen has been defining the HIV capsid structure (the region containing  the viral genetic material) and searching for ways to inhibit the  deadly virus. Dr Patrick Allen is the only black scientist funded by  the National Institute of Allergic and Infectious Diseases (Division of  AIDS) to do AIDS/HIV research. Yet, more blacks suffer from the disease  than any other group in the U.S. </p>
						  <p>Dr Allen founded the Black Biomedical Research  Movement (BBRM) in order to increase the number of black researchers  and to improve relations between the African American Community and the  Biomedical field, thus heightening awareness and increasing the general  level of consciousness on health issues within the black community. He  promotes involvement in all aspects of biomedical research. The BBRM is  a movement where health is the priority. He works with fellow  scientists to encourage young African Americans to pursue research  careers. Allen also organes a broad-based popular media awareness  campaign and is pushing for legislative action that addresses these  health issues. </p>
						  <p><img src="../images/Ujama.jpg" alt="" align="right" border="0" height="389" width="300">HIV  is just one of several health problems America's black community is  vulnerable to. Other issues at the forefront include sickle cell  anemia, hypertension, diabetes, prostate cancer, heart disease and  infant mortality. The AIDS epidemic has hit an increasingly  disproportionate number of blacks, but less than one percent of U.S.  biomedical researchers are black. The most likely person to be infected  today (in the United States) is a black woman 18-25 years old," Allen  said. He and CU colleague Larry Gold hold a 1997 patent for creating  specific RNA binding sites to inhibit HIV "With few black researchers  and few black participants in drug research, there needs to be a  cultural shift so the black community gets involved in biomedicine,"  Allen said. "A history of fear and suspicion in the black community  toward the biomedical establishment is adding to a major public health  problem. In the last 10 years, HIV has really affected the black  community, and to not have any doing the research ... it definitely  affects the work in the labs." Allen said "I'm trying to raise a black  health-consciousness thing. You have to start somewhere, because if you  don't, the legacy of health problems is just going to get worse. It's a  disturbing legacy already. The annual HIV infection rate for black men  is six times that for white men, while the rate for black women is 14  times that for white women, and 80% of the infants born with the HIV  virus are Black," he said.</p>
						  <p>The black community has historically distrusted  the medical research com- munity. Most recently, the nation's attention  was captured by details of the so-called Tuskegee experiments, which  were conducted on black men with syphilis from 1932 to 1972. Those  conducting the experiments deliberately withheld treatment from the  men. But that's just one example of a national legacy of abusive  research on black people. It has kept black people away from being  researchers themselves, which in turn has created a sense of  opposition. That separation is what Allen is trying to overcome. "There  aren't a lot of blacks in science, but if there were more, you wouldn't  have so much of a feeling of 'them against us," he said. The model  Allen has in mind, is get- ting black people involved in Bio- medical  Research and encouraging them to focus on health issues of par- ticular  concern to blacks.</p>
						  <p>He's contacted everyone from come- dian Chris  Rock to U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher, trying to enlist them in a  long-term battle to raise awareness in the black communi- ty, both to  encourage new researchers and to get black people just to think about  their health. "Black people def- initely know that blood sugar, blood  pressure, various cancers, are big, big problems in the black  community, but they're the least likely people to go to free health  fairs," Allen pointed out. "You have to get them thinking like that."  'I want the nation to say this is important, and for black people to  realize it," Allen said.</p>
						  <p>At the present time Dr Patrick Allen is working  on getting some funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH)  through the University of Colorado to write a grant to fund the  training of all minority students from the 7th grade straight up to  undergraduate and graduate school level in the field of Biomedical  Research. He already has a commitment from Howard Hughes Medical  Institute to match whatever funds are raised for grant money from the  NIH. </p>
						  <p>This year from June 15th- 17th at the Juneteenth  Celebration in Denver, Colorado, the BBRM will be kicking off its first  Health expo, a Black Health Symposium. There will be interactive  stations each focusing on every health issue affecting the black  community and the correlation between diet and health. </p>
						  <p><strong>THE BLACK BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH MOVEMENT:</strong></p>
						  <p>The specific objectives of the Black Biomedical  Research Movement are to aggressively promote Black health  consciousness and involvement in all facets of biomedical research. Our  hope and ideals are essentially the same as those of the U.S.  Department of Health and Human Services and the National Institutes of  Health, in trying to reduce health disparity in minority populations  and increase the pool of NIH funded minority scientists, respectively. </p>
						  <p>In addition to the impressive list of ongoing  traditional efforts at HHS and NIH that target these issues, BBRM will  use very non-traditional approaches to show Black people that our  health and longevity should be priority issues in our everyday lives. </p>
						  <p>Furthermore, our disfranchisement from  biomedical research is directly related to our poor health. Black  people, in the United States, have a perilous legacy of health problems  that continues to worsen with each generation.We suffer the brunt of  all health disparities, yet we are least represented in every aspect of  biomedicine. </p>
						  <p>In 1998, U.S. Congress made a historical request  for a state-of-emergency because of the devastating impact of HIV/AIDS  on the Black community in this country. President Clinton and Secretary  Shalala declared a state-of-crisis, and federal funds were released to  help relieve this crisis.</p>
						  <p>Early in 1999, ABC Nightline reported on a study  published in the New England Journal of Medicine that clearly  demonstrates racial disparity in medical diagnosis. It suggested that  our health care providers diagnose the same medical condition  differently, based on race.</p>
						  <p>Healthy People 2000/2010 is a federal initiative  to eliminate health disparity in minority populations of the United  States. How do we expect to eliminate health disparities when there is  disparity in the way the system of medicine diagnoses our health  problems? How can we eliminate health disparity with the deep-rooted  fear, mistrust, suspicion and lack of confidence that the Black  community holds for the biomedical research and health care system? How  can we ever expect to eliminate health disparity in ten years when the  disgraceful third- world infant mortality rate among america's black  people remains persistent?</p>
						  <p>We applaud all efforts aimed at improving the  health of the black community and increasing involvement in  biomedicine. We recognize their importance and realize that these  efforts are crucially important for resolving these Black health  problems. However, there is a serious and urgent need for a cohesive  and coordinated Black health campaign. We need to be aware of Black  health problems and learn how to identify and control them. Our  religious leaders and political leaders and community leaders need to  push Black health real hard. And especially our leaders in popular  culture (Michael Jordan, Spike Lee, Chris Rock, Oprah Winfrey, Jay Z,  Wu Tang Clan, DMX, Ziggy Marley, Culture, Bounty Killer, Capleton and  others) need to push Black health to the fullest. </p>
						  <p>Health has to become a priority for us, only  then can betterment be expected. Our personal health should be the  first thing we think about. We can live longer, healthier lives-Black  people. Four-hundred years ago, when we were being brought here, we  were strong, fit, healthy, vibrant people. (That is without mention of  the stringent "survival of the fittest" screen that was inherent to the  process; many failed to survive the treacherous journey from Africa).  Today, we are among the sickest people in this country. This does not  make me proud to be black. It does not matter if you are illiterate or  Harvard educated; and it does not matter if you are poor and destitute  or if rich and well-celebrated and you are on television every day; and  it does not matter if you are Christian or Muslim or Democrat or  Republican, in jail or on the streets, if you are Black, diabetes,  sickle cell anemia, AIDS, hypertension, infant mortality, asthma, heart  disease and certain types of cancer will always be our problem, know  that.</p>
						  <p><em>I am doing this for Black People, my people.<br>
						    I am trying to preserve Black People,<br>
						    400 years ago when we were brougbt here<br>
						    from Africa we were the healthiest <br>

						    I want Black people to know that.<br>
