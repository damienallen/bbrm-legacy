          <p>
            When Patrick Allen, Ph.D., was awarded a $1.2 million grant from the
            National Institutes of Health (NIH) to define the structure of the
            AIDS virus, he didn't know that only 0.37 percent of biomedical
            research funds were given to black scientists. Upon reflection,
            however, Allen found that the startlingly low percentage was
            consistent with his personal experiences. Throughout his
            undergraduate years at Springfield College in Massachusetts and his
            graduate studies at the University of California-Santa Cruz, and now
            as a postdoctoral fellow and research associate at the University of
            Colorado-Boulder, time and time again, Allen was and is the only
            black person in the lab.
          </p>
          <p>
            At first, being the minority in an industry that's traditionally
            dominated by white men didn't faze him. But the news of so few black
            investigators being funded for scientific research did disturb him.
            Allen already knew about the higher-than-average incidence of heart
            disease, diabetes, high blood sugar and high blood cholesterol among
            black Americans. (See "Black Health Facts," p. 26.) But when the
            numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed
            that nearly 75 percent of all deaths from AIDS occur in black men;
            that black women have the disease at a rate that is 16 times that of
            white women; and that two-thirds of all children with HIV are black,
            Allen realized there was a health crisis in black America and that
            called for immediate action.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I never dreamed this would be a concern of mine," Allen says. "But
            when I think about so few blacks involved in AIDS research, and so
            many blacks who are affected by it, that polarity got me going."
          </p>
          <p>
            And Allen, 38, has been going strong around the country promoting a
            new health consciousness in the black community. "Black people are
            in bad health, and it's not necessary. Health consciousness and
            caring about your body is not that difficult. And it's not asking a
            lot," says Allen, who launched the Black Biomedical Research
            Movement (BBRM), a non-profit organization set up through the
            University of Colorado. This is his attempt to encourage young black
            students to enter the field of biomedical research, while also
            forging a new mindset in minority communities to take responsibility
            for their own health and well-being.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is bound to be a tough challenge, but Allen has faced down fierce
            opponents before. Born and raised in Jamaica, he always loved school
            because good grades got him the attention he liked-not only from
            family members-but from peers as well. A move to New York at age 13
            changed everything. Being attentive in the classroom, finishing
            homework on time, and exemplary report cards cast him as the
            resident nerd. By high school, he figured out that the American way
            of attracting attention was through athletics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Allen took up wrestling and excelled. By college, he was competing
            in national tournaments and eventually was invited to the 1984
            Olympic trials. Fortuitously, a knee injury put an end to his
            wrestling career, so he turned to biology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Patrick Allen, Ph.D., realized there was a health crisis in black
            America. "...when I think about so few blacks involved in AIDS
            research, and so many blacks who are affected by it, that polarity
            got me going."'
          </p>
          <p>
            Allen credits his years as a serious wrestler for the discipline he
            now relies upon as a serious scientist.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Science isn't glamorous," he says. "You have to be rigorous, you
            have to have discipline, you have to do things meticulously and
            sometimes nothing happens. Wrestling helped me learn those things."
          </p>
          <p>
            As one of relatively few black biomedical researchers wrestling with
            the AIDS virus, Allen splits his energy between exploring what
            inhibits the destructive properties of the virus (he was awarded a
            patent in 1997 for a discovery he made to that effect), and what
            contributes to the health crisis in black America. He sees a clear
            connection between the magnitude of the health crisis and the dearth
            of black scientists and biomedical researchers. In fact, he
            emphasizes, the crisis may be more about mistrust and fear than
            viruses, heart disease, or blood abnormalities.
          </p>
          <p>
            "It's beyond me how to forge a new consciousness," he admits. "But
            just because it's beyond you, doesn't mean you can't do something
            about it."
          </p>
          <p>
            Allen believes a cultural and historic mistrust of science and
            medicine must be overcome before African Americans can obviate the
            growing statistics that reflect the poor health of their race. To
            assist him in this crusade, he is enlisting the support of
            celebrities, athletes and musicians (including film director Spike
            Lee and Denver Bronco's running back Terrell Davis) to contribute
            money, become spokespersons, or disseminate accurate information
            about the crisis through their work and their community outreach.
          </p>
          <p>
            He is also pursuing support from traditional biomedical research
            funders. In 1999, the Office of AIDS Research at NIH became a
            benefactor of the BBRM. One of the institutes' first gestures of
            support to the BBRM was to underwrite Allen's participation in a
            reggae concert that he co-produced in Negril, Jamaica, in April
            1999, which featured musicians who promoted awareness of how AIDS
            has infiltrated the black community. As an added bonus, the DuPont
            Corp. and the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of
            Colored People], joined together to donate 10,000 condoms to the
            mostly college-aged music lovers on spring break who attended the
            concert.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Allen is going straight to the masses with his message, he
            also has been negotiating with U.S. Surgeon General Dr. David
            Satcher and Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalaia
            about holding symposiums aimed at heightening awareness. Although
            collaborating with these political entities is a time-consuming
            process, Allen feels that their participation is critical to
            manifesting a past-due wake-up call for all Americans.

            <h3>Black Health Facts</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Approximately 33 percent of black men die of cardiovascular
                disease compared to 5.5 percent who die from homicide.
                Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in black
                men and women.
              </li>
              <li>
                Seventy-five percent of all deaths from AIDS occur in black men.
              </li>
              <li>
                Black women have AIDS at 16 times the rate of white women, and
                two-thirds of all children with HIV are black.
              </li>
              <li>
                For fiscal year 1997, the budget for research programs at the
                National Cancer Institute (NCI) relevant to minorities was
                aproximately 1 percent of the total NCI budget.
              </li>
              <li>
                According to the Healthy People 2000 federal initiative, the
                cancer death rate of African Americans had already exceeded the
                year 2000 target of 175 deaths by reaching 172 deaths per
                100,000 in 1995.
              </li>
              <li>
                In 1995, only 2.8 percent of all biological scientists were
                black.

          <h4>One of Too Few Fighting the Problem</h4>
          <p>
            While he is one of few black biomedical researchers who've found the
            time and the resources to take on the challenge of improving black
            health, Allen certainly is not the only person attempting to counter
            these alarming trends.
          </p>
          <p>
            Healthy People 2000 and 2010 are federal initiatives that also aim
            to improve minority health.
          </p>
          <p>
            Emerging from the secretary of Health and Human Services office in
            1990, the goals of Healthy People 2000 included reducing health
            disparities among minorities. The updated version of the program,
            Healthy People 2010, has the goal of eliminating health disparities.
            Numerous calls to Healthy People 2000 for more details about the
            project were not returned.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then there is the NIH's Office of Research on Minority Health
            (ORMH), the mission of which is to improve health among minorities.
          </p>
          <p>
            "[ORMH realizes that] minority Americans are not fully benefiting
            from the advances made in biomedical research," Allen says.
            Consequently, they have implemented an array of programs to "improve
            the health of minorities across their life span."
          </p>
          <p>
            Although he appreciates whafs being done in the context of these
            government-launched initiatives, Allen finds it hard to believe
            these goals will be met if the majority of black Americans aren't
            aware that the problem exists, or how grave it is.
          </p>
          <p>
            Without widespread public confidence in science and medicine, as
            well as simple knowledge of the initiatives, he says, it will be
            impossible to reach most of those goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reclaiming the health of millions of Americans is as important as
            defeating other problems facing minorities such as escalating
            incarceration rates, infant mortality, teen pregnancy, drug abuse
            and poverty, Allen says. But before health becomes a priority, he
            believes African Americans must commit to themselves and to their
            community that they will participate in whatever it takes to be
            healthy.

            "Today, [HIV is] predominately a black disease, and you have the
            black community and the church not owning up to the fact that it's
            decimating our community," he says.

            Apriel Hodari, a graduate student in physics at the University of
            Maryland and a recipient of a National Science Foundation
            fellowship, agrees with Allen. She volunteered at the Children's
            AIDS Network Designed for Interface Involvement in Virginia and was
            astounded that the overwhelming majority of people who came for
            service were black mothers and children. And yet, when she launched
            a program to recruit other volunteers, she was successful in signing
            up only two black women. All the rest were middle-aged white women.

          <p>
            "Generally, people don't act like AIDS is an issue for black women,"
            she says. "So as a minority scientist, I really support what Dr.
            Allen is doing."

            So does Deborah Fontaine, African American Outreach program director
            of AIDS Atlanta. "We need to put a new face on AIDS. Most people
            think of someone gay, a prostitute or drug addict. They don't think
            of a 53-year-old black woman, who has been monogamous with someone
            for 10 years, doesn't practice safe sex once with someone else and
            acquires the disease. Nor do they think of a young black girl who
            gets it the very first time she has sex. When it comes to HIV, the
            black community is very judgmental and homophobic, and they simply
            don't know what's really going on because of a lack of education
            that's culturally geared into the black community."

            When I tell black people I am a biomedical researcher, I hear them
            say, "You don't see many brothers doing that. How'd you get into
            that?" <br />
            - Patrick Allen

          <h4>Expanding the Black Researcher Population</h4>
          <p>
            Allen and other black researchers theorize that if more black
            researchers are conducting clinical trials for new drugs or
            procedures, then more minorities will be inclined to participate in
            the studies. And participation in those clinical trials, he
            emphasizes, is critical to the understanding and treatment of the
            health problems unique to African Americans.
          </p>
          <p>
            A spokesperson at the Office of AIDS Research at the NIH who
            requested anonymity says that their agency has put "significant time
            and energy into increasing enrollment of minority representation in
            such tests." In fact, she says the relative number of participants
            in most studies is comparable to the percentage of minorities who
            suffer from the diseases. "It's something we've taken very seriously
            for a long time."
          </p>
          <p>
            And Clifton Poodry, director of the Minority Opportunities in
            Research Program at the NIH, says attempts to recruit young minority
            scientists have been in place for 20 years. Poodry's office created
            programs that include providing funding for minority students to go
            into research-oriented institutions, improving research skills of
            faculty at minority-serving institutions, and developing
            infrastructures at minority research institutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            "There are many success stories that come out of these programs, but
            the overall numbers of minority students entering a scientific or
            research-based career are the same as they were before. This worries
            us," admits Poodry, who believes that the poor economics of so many
            minorities has a lot to do with why so few enter the field.
          </p>
          <p>Allen disagrees.</p>
          <p>
            "This lack of relationship between the black community and health
            consciousness is not something you can escape by becoming educated
            or wealthy, like you might be able to with crime or drugs. This is
            something that affects all black people," he says. Taking it a step
            further, he continues:
          </p>
          <p>
            "When I tell black people I'm a biomedical researcher, I hear them
            say, 'You don't see many brothers doing that. How'd you get into
            that?'"
          </p>
          <p>
            He links those questions with the underlying mistrust that distracts
            young black students regardless of their economic background from
            pursuing medical research. Although he recognizes and appreciates
            that many of the black students who do study science gravitate to
            medical school, he believes it is equally as important to encourage
            students to choose a career in research.
          </p>
          <p>
            "By their senior year, students hit this tradition of mistrust and
            get messages like, 'Come on, you're the only black. Why are you
            going into this?' That's when they choose medical school instead."

          <p>
            Allen plans to use the BBRM to turn the tide concerning research. He
            has already secured a half-dozen commitments from prize-winning,
            heavily funded scientists to serve as mentors to talented, young
            black science students to be selected from existing science
            programs. One such program is The College Fund/UNCF-Merek Science
            Initiative, which steers black students toward research through
            internships with the pharmaceutical and research giant, Merck &amp;
            Co.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jerry Bryant, director of The College Fund/UNCF-Merek Initiative,
            applauds Allen's efforts and shares his goal of drawing black
            science students away from the medical profession into research.
          </p>
          <p>
            "[Students] know what getting an M.D. is," says Bryant. "But they
            don't know how to develop research in a novel area no one has ever
            studied before, and that's kind of scary." Allen and Bryant agree
            that exposing students to the unknown research environment will not
            only spark new interest in the field but understanding as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Allen believes that black and minority communities are
            disenfranchised from biomedical research, and the attitude that
            results from that is: "We're suspicious - we're afraid we're going
            to be used as guinea pigs."
          </p>
          <p>
            This, Allen is well aware, has been the case in the past. Between
            1932 and 1972, the so-called Tuskegee experiments denied black men
            with syphilis effective drug therapy. In 1997, President Clinton
            formally apologized for the wrongful experiments. In 1998, the
            Congressional Black Caucus declared a state of emergency in protest
            to them. 'Mat same year, President Clinton dedicated $156 million in
            honor of the crisis to research, prevention and treatment of HIV and
            AIDS in the African-American community.
          </p>
          <p>
            With this history and with questionable research still being
            conducted, how can Allen confidently encourage people of color to
            engage in more clinical testing of new drugs?
          </p>
          <p>He looks to the women's movement for part of the answer.</p>
          <p>
            "Women now trust science more than they did 20 years ago because
            they got involved in their own wellbeing. There are lots more women
            in science now. And there are seminars, classes, support groups,
            magazines and books written just for women and the issues unique to
            them because there was a need for them to come together and take
            responsibility for what was happening.
          </p>
          <p>
            "In the same way, the more blacks that get into science and
            research, the more trust will be established, and then more positive
            changes can be accomplished. If you're serious about minority health
            issues, then we need a campaign. We need to put this issue to the
            forefront and make sure its sustained over the next 20 years."
          </p>
          <p>
            Most people agree awareness and outreach are critical if profound
            change in the health of minorities is to occur. Poodry, for one,
            believes that Allen's passion and commitment to improving the health
            of the black community is important and admirable. But, Poodry
            reluctantly admits that he's afraid the energy Allen is spending on
            the movement to increase awareness is taking away from his research
            as a talented and promising scientist.
          </p>
          <p>
            "There are so few minority scientists that can get competitive
            funding (such as the NIH grant). He shouldn't have to be doing the
            outreach. It's a shame that he feels he has to because no one else
            is."
          </p>
          <p>
            Allen's response to this concern, which is echoed from other
            colleagues, is sadness.
          </p>
          <p>
            "It hurts me to hear that I love science, and I don't want to
            disappoint my mentors and the people who believe in me," he says.
            After a pause, he concludes with, 'But how do you measure publishing
            two papers a year compared to starting a movement that could change
            the consciousness of people?"
          </p>
          <p>
            This may indeed be the most difficult wrestling match of his life.
