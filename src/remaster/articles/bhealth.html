            HIV affects proportionately more black people than it does white
            people.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only one of the nation's primary investigators on an HIV research
            Project is black.
          </p>
          <p>Patrick Allen has noticed the discrepancy.</p>
          <p>
            Allen, a research associate at CU, is that black primary
            investigator. He's also starting a long term project maybe 30 years,
            he said, and maybe 50 - to bring black people: into biomedical
            research.
          </p>
          <p>
            "In the last eight to 10 years, HIV has really affected the black
            community, and to not have any doing the research ... it definitely
            affects the work in the labs," Allen said. "I'm, trying to raise a
            black health-consciousness thing. You have to start somewhere,
            because if you don't, the legacy of health problems is just going to
            get worse."
          </p>
          <p>
            It's a disturbing legacy already. The annual HIV infection rate for
            black men is six times that for white men, while the rate for black
            women is 14 times that for white womem and HIV is just one of
            several health problems America's black community is particularly
            vuenerable to.
          </p>
          <p>
            Which is why Allen is trying to spark a national black biomedical
            research movement. He's contacted everyone from comedian Chris Rock
            to U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher, trying to enlist them in a
            long-term battle to raise awareness in the black community, both to
            encourage new researchers and to get black people just to think
            about their health.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Black, people definitely know that blood sugar, blood pressure,
            various cancers, are big, big problems in the black community, but
            they're the least likely people to go to free health fairs," Allen
            explained. "You have to get them thinking like that."
          </p>
          <p>
            So two years ago, he set out to change the way people think. It
            wasn't that he was hit by a thunderbolt, he said, but he realized
            that if he didn't do what he could things wouldn't get any better.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I want the nation to say this is important, and for black people to
            realize it,' Allen said. "Just because you say it, black women
            aren't going to start getting mammogram screens, and black men won't
            just start checking their blood pressure."
          </p>
          <p class="excerpt">
            "If you're black and you have kids they're going to have health
            problems based on the kind of genes that we have."
            <br />
            -Patrick Allen, CU researcher
          </p>
          <p>
            One reason that they won't is because the black community has
            historically distrusted the medical research community. Most
            recently, the nations attention was captured by details of the
            so-called Tuskegee experiments, which were conducted on black men
            with syphilis from 1932 to 1972. Those conducting the experiments
            deliberately withheld treatment from the men.
          </p>
          <p>
            But that's just one example of a national legacy of abusive research
            on black people, Allen said. It has kept black people away from
            being researchers themselves, which in turn has created a sense of
            opposition.
          </p>
          <p>That separation is what Allen is trying, to overcome.</p>
          <p>
            "There aren't a lot of blacks in science, but if there were more,
            you wouldn't have so much of a feeling of "them against us?" he
            said. "Being a part of the scientific community, people ask me
            questions, and I don't respond the way they think I will because I'm
            black. They say, 'Wait a minute are you one of them or one of us?'"
          </p>
          <p>
            Allen compares his fledgling efforts to those of women over the past
            few decades. Women have become doctors and researchers in greater
            numbers in the past 30 to 50 years, Allen said, and many of them
            have specialized in woman-specific fields like OB/GYN.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's the model Allen said he has in mind, getting black people
            into his field and encouraging them to focus on health issues of
            particular concern to blacks.
          </p>
          <p>
            "If you're black and you have kids, they're going to have health
            problems based on the kind of genes that we have, just like other
            groups have health problems based on their genes," he said.
          </p>
          <p>
            And if this campaign works, Allen said, black people as a whole
            might start thinking about their health.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I'm not asking all black pegple to become researchers. That would
            be ridiculous," he said. "I just want people to be conscious of
            their health."
