                  HIV RESEARCHER LEAVES SCIENCE BEHIND TO FIGHT FOR HEALTH OF

              </p>
              <p><strong>by Rebecca Jones</strong></p>
              <p>Rocky Mountain News Staff Writer</p>
              <p>
                Ever since his youthful days as a bookworm, Patrick Allen wanted
                to be a scientist. After landing a prestigious undergraduate
                internship at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Institute in New
                York in the summer of 1983, he knew what he wanted to study:
                HIV.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Jamaican-born Allen, 38, went from success to success: a
                bachelor's degree in biology from Springfield (Mass.) College, a
                doctorate in , molecular biology from the University of
                California at Santa Cruz, a post-doctoral fellowship, and
                finally a research professorship at the University of Colorado.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1995 he received a five-year, $1.2 million grant from the
                National Institutes of Health to further his study of the virus
                that causes AIDS. He's believed to be the only black person in
                America to head an AIDS-resench project. He wrote papers, was
                awarded patents on potentia AIDS-fighting drugs and was invited
                to lecture around the country. Lucrative job offers started
                flowing in.
              </p>
              <p>
                And then, just when everything he'd always dreamed of was within
                his grasp, Patrick Allen walked away.
              </p>
              <p>
                He turned down the high-profile jobs. He's wrapping up the last
                of his experiments, his mind and his heart aren't in HIV
                research these days.
              </p>
              <p>
                Instead, he's following the trail of another discovery, the most
                important of his life, and he didn't make it in his lab. He made
                it while doing research for a seminar on HIV he was invited tc
                present to nursing students injamaica iff 1996. Rather than talk
                to them about the genetic structure of the virus, he thought
                he'd spend some time discussing its impact on people.
              </p>
              <p>
                "One of the first things I learned was that the number of blacks
                in America with HIV outnumbered all other groups," he says.
                Recent studies show that the annual HIV infection rate among
                black men is six times that of white men and the rate of
                infection in black women is 16 times that of white women.
                Two-thirds of the children born with the virus in America are
                black.
              </p>
              <p>
                "And how many black HIV investigators were there? I'm the only
                one," Allen says. "That put me in a state of disbelief. It
                puzzled me. I had to ask, what is my value to the black
                community, and what is my value as a scientist?"
              </p>
              <p>
                Allen determined that he could be of more value to others by
                putting his HIV research asidefor the time being and pouring all
                his considerable energy into a broader area: improving the
                health of every black person.
              </p>
              <p>
                To do that, Allen launched the Black Biomedical Research
                Movement, an organization with goals on several health-related
                fronts: He wants to encourage young blacks to take classes in
                the sciences; he wants to get more blacks involved in research;
                he wants more blacks to participate in clinical trials and to
                get involved with the governmental agencies that make funding
                decisions and set priorities for medical research.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond that, he wants blacks to take a more active role in
                protecting their health so that race-related disparities in
                health disappear.
              </p>
              <p>
                To do that, he has to get people's attention. He has to get them
                thinking and talking about health care. "Something has to be
                done, and it has to rival the civil rights movement in fervor
                and intensity," he says.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's not just AIDS that stalks blacks indisproportioiiate
                numbers. Diabetes, high blood pressure, sickle-cell anemia and
                certain kinds of cancer continue to plague blacks far more than
                they do other ethnic groups. Much of the problem is
                self-perpetuated, Allen says.
              </p>
              <p>
                Blacks know they're at risk for certain diseases yet they don't
                take the steps,necessary to protect themselves, he says. "Blacks
                know they have problems, they know their parents had problems,
                but they continue to abuse the situation," he says. "We're
                afraid of finding out what's wrong with as. We don't go to the
                doctor. We wait until we're so sick we're about to die!
              </p>
              <p>
                "Blacks are disenfranchised from the whole situation. This has a
                profound negative effect on the black community. There's a lack
                of trust, a lack of confidence, suspicion. People hear that I'm
                studying AIDS and they'll say, 'Wow, you don't see a lot of
                brothers doing that.' "
              </p>
              <p>
                Health problems cut across the spectrum of black life, he says.
                "You can't get an education and move out of the inner city and
                think you'll get away from it," he says, "because the
                hypertension will follow you."
              </p>
              <p>
                Allen hopes blacks who might not listen to the mostly white
                health care establishment will listen to him. "I know I was
                educated by white scientists," he says, "but isn't it true?
                Aren't the numbers real? Something has to happen' "
              </p>
              <p>
                So Allen is back on the lecture circuit, but this time he's
                talking about grand-scale cultural changes, not things
                observable with a microscope. He's back to seeking grants, but
                now they're for assistance to young black students and
                researchers, not for his own research. He's using music and
                other cultural lures to draw black audiences, fluently mixing
                music an microbiology. In Denver, he hopes to join with the
                9News Health Fair to tie in health screenings at the annual
                Juneteenth celebration in the Five Points neighborhood.
              </p>
              <p>
                Allen himself is a picture of health. A college wrestler who at
                one time hoped to make the U.S. Olympics wrestling team, he
                continues to push his body. He routinely goes for 40 and 50-mile
                bike rides in the foothills and spends every free moment in the
                outdoors, often in the company of his 10-year-old son.
              </p>
              <p>
                One day, he figures, he'll resume his AIDS research. But not
                now.
              </p>
              <p>
                "I can't lose my focus," he says, acknowledging that he's become
                a man obsessed with a vision. "I don't imagine I'll be the one
                to make anything happen, but I can get it started. This has got
                to go on until it starts to take on a life of its own.
              </p>
              <p>
                "When the numbers (of blacks with avoidable health problems)
                starts to come down, then we'll celebrate. But no celebrations
                until we see that really happen.
