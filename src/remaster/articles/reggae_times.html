          A Jamaican<br />
          Destined to<br />
          Make A<br />
          Change
        </h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        An accomplished Molecular Biologist in the United States, Dr Patrick
        Allen still remembers his roots in Jamaica's music. On a recent visit,
        during which which he spoke with Jamaica's most prominent entertainers,
        Dr. Allen took the time out to chat with RT magazine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Allen, who was born in the Warika Hills area off Windward Road, recently
        won an award and was given a grant of $1 million by the United States
        Government to further his studies and research in the HIV virus which
        causes AIDS. However, this scientist has undertaken to increase the
        health consciousness of black people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Targeting Jamaica, reggae/dancehall music and its artistes as the full
        force in getting his health awareness message across, he has proposed a
        concert with some of the top names in Jamiacan entertainment. Dr Allen
        said that the concert would be an easy way to help get the health
        message across, while it will also back up the regional meetings on
        HIV/AIDS awareness, which will be held on February 24 - 25, 2000.
        However, the concert will only be held in Jamaica, and on the same day
        as the meeting, which will be held at the Jamaica Grande Hotel.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The support I get from the artistes is incredible, Luciano, Beenie Man,
        Third World, Anthony B, Tony Rebel and Culture... you name them, they
        all understand what I am trying to do and are willing to help out," Dr.
        Allen said. He told RT that he had already been offerd a venue for the
        concert.
      </p>
      <p>
        And with all the responsiblility he has, this home-grown scientist still
        found time to start The Black Bio-medical Research Movement, a movement
        which centers around black health issues. "It never really hit me, the
        disparity of how little blacks there are in the study and the many
        blacks with the disease (AIDS)," Dr. Allen said. "We suffer the brunt of
        disparity which is why I started the movement."
      </p>
      <p>
        He says he decided to start the movement after a fellow scientist told
        him "You might just be the only black person with the ability and the
        funds to research HIV in blacks." Dr. Allen says he now feels a little
        better knowing that there is a health movement in for black people, "I
        want being healthy to be something cool, like when I go to Japan and see
        the way people are dressed immediately I know that it's a black people
        thing."
      </p>
      <p>
        He says he wants Jamaica to know what's happening, "... because Jamaica
        and Jamaicans are special and this is for the black people, it's not
        just about HIV, its about being healthy."
