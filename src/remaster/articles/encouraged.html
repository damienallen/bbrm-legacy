              <p><strong>By Katy Human</strong></p>

              <p>
                DENVER - Patrick Allen compares his dream of a 'black biomedical
                research movement" to the women's movement.
              </p>
              <p>
                As increasingly emancipated women moved into the workforce, some
                ended up in research. Many of them pursued topics with
                particular importance to women, such as breast cancer and
                menopause.
              </p>
              <p>
                Allen, a black research professor at the University of Colorado,
                wants to see the same thing happen for African Americans. The
                scientist, who studies HIV viruses, believes the health
                awareness of African Americans would improve if more black
                students pursued biomedical research careers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Monday, Allen delivered that message to about 40 students from
                advanced science classes at Montbello High School in Denver. He
                talked about his own experiences as a student and researcher and
                encouraged the kids to get a college education at least, and to
                consider the medical research profession.
              </p>
              <p>
                "Knowledge is king," Allen told the, kids, promising "it gets so
                much better later on. When you go to college, you get to decide
                what to study, you have choices. And in graduate school, you
                only have to study what you want."
              </p>
              <p>
                Allen wanted to study biology. As an undergraduate at
                Springfield College in Massachusetts and a graduate student at
                the University of California at Santa Cruz, he found himself
                increasingly drawn to molecular biology - the study of the
                proteins and nucleic acids that make cells work.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now, the CU researcher. studies the proteins and nucleic acids
                of HIV viruses, which cause AIDS.
              </p>
              <p>
                He's investigating a particular transformation that HIV viruses
                must undergo before they become infectious. If scientists could
                interfere with that transformation, he said, "We could stop the
                progression of the disease."
              </p>
              <p>
                Allen showed a slide of some promising experimental results.
                "How do you know that something that works in a lab will work in
                people?" asked sophomore Mayra Loya, 14.
              </p>
              <p>
                "You don't," Allen responded. On average, it takes $400 million
                and 10 years for a research project to become a human drug, he
                said. After laboratory work such as his, a potential drug must
                be tested in animals as well as in human clinical trials.
              </p>
              <p>
                Amanda Comstubble, 17, a senior who plans to study biology in
                college next year, said she was impressed with Allen's message.
                She said she's interested in biomedical research because she
                thinks people need better inforination about health issues.
              </p>
              <p>
                "When I was in junior high, I thought you could only get HIV if
                you were gay," she said.
              </p>
              <p>
                In fact, the fastest-growing population of people infected with
                HIV is young women between 18 and 25 who are black or Hispanic.
                "And across America, the cancer rate is going down, except in
                black communities," Allen said.
              </p>
              <p>
                He cited several reasons for the discrepancies, including
                mistrust of the science and research communities by many African
                Americans. A certain skepticism is well founded, he said,
                describing the infamous Tuskegee experiments in which black men
                with syphilis were denied treatment.
              </p>
              <p>
                He emphasized the importance of moving forward. When a student
                asked Allen about a theory that an elite group of scientists
                manufactured the HIV virus to kill "undesirable" people, Allen
                refused to speculate.
              </p>
              <p>
                "It doesn't matter, because a lot of people are dying now and
                that's what I care about," he said.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the past two years, Allen has been quietly recruiting his
                professional colleagues into what he calls the "black biomedical
                research movement." He's encouraging them to take on promising
                young black Ph.D. students, and is even trying to persuade
                personalities such as television, star Oprah Winfrey, Denver
                Bronco Terrell Davis and comedian Chris Rock to promote black
                health consciousness and encourage young minorities to pursue
                research careers.
