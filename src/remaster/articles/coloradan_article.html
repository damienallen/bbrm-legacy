                Pat Allen targets AIDS research, raising health consciousness in
                the black community
              </p>
              <p><strong>By Jim Scott</strong></p>
              <p>Office of News Services</p>
              <p>
                As a Westchester, N.Y., high school student in the late 1970s,
                Patrick Allen was an admitted bookworm. He spent many wintry
                afternoons in the wrestling room doing his homework, waiting for
                his younger brother to finish practice.
              </p>
              <p>
                "It smelled terrible in there," recalled Allen. "Nothing but
                sweat."
              </p>
              <p>
                Although the wrestling coaches encouraged him to try out for the
                team, he politely declined and went back to his books. But the
                coaches' invitations eventually planted the seeds of competition
                in him.
              </p>
              <p>
                In his junior year, Allen joined the team, losing only a handful
                of matches. During his senior year he won every match, earning
                all-state honors.
              </p>
              <p>
                Allen went on to attend Springfield College in Massachusetts,
                where he was named to the NCAA All-American wrestling team in
                1984.
              </p>
              <p>
                The message? When Allen sets his sights on a target, you can be
                sure of a bull's eye.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now a research associate in the molecular, cellular and
                developmental biology department at the University of Colorado
                at Boulder, Allen is a principal investigator on a $1.2 million
                grant from the National Institute of Health. The grant's purpose
                is to define the structure of the HIV, the virus that causes
                AIDS, and to search for inhibitors to target specific proteins.
              </p>
              <p>
                Allen, believed to be the only black principal investigator on
                an AIDS research project in the nation, hopes his work may
                eventually help in designing new drugs to fight HIV. He and
                colleague Larry Gold, a professor of biology at CU-Boulder, had
                a patent approved in 1997 to create specific RNA binding sites
                to inhibit the lethal virus.
              </p>
              <p>
                Two years ago, Allen spearheaded a fledgling organization called
                the Black Biomedical Research Movement to involve more blacks in
                biomedical research.
              </p>
              <p>
                "This is not about affirmative action, religion, politics or
                racism," he said. "In its simplest form, this is a science
                outreach program with the black community being the primary
                target group."
              </p>
              <p>
                One of Allen's biggest concerns? Although AIDS in the nation's
                black community has evolved into a full-blown epidemic, less
                than one percent of U.S. biomedical researchers are black - "a
                disenfranchisement that directly affects health," he said.
              </p>
              <p>
                According to a 1998 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation of
                Menlo Park, Calif., the annual HIV infection rate of AIDS among
                black men is six times that of white men. Nearly one-third of
                new AIDS cases in black men resulted from intravenous drug use,
                compared to one-fourth of new U.S. cases in white men.
              </p>
              <p>
                The rate of HIV infection for black women is now 16 times that
                of white women, according to the study. Among black women,
                heterosexual contact is the primary mode of transmission, and
                two-thirds of children born with the virus in America are black.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to seeing more blacks go into biomedical research,
                Allen is determined to raise health consciousness in the black
                community - goals that go hand-in-hand. Blacks are
                disproportionately struck by a number of diseases such as
                hypertension, sickle-cell anemia, certain types of cancer and
                AIDS. The disparity is caused in part by social, cultural and
                economic differences and a historical mistrust of the biomedical
                community, he said.
              </p>
              <p>
                "The fear and suspicion in the black community of the biomedical
                establishment is a major public health problem that reaches
                beyond these diseases," Allen noted. "What we really need is a
                massive cultural shift to take place for such changes to occur."
              </p>
              <p>
                The ultimate goal of his movement, he explained, is to promote
                black health consciousness at all ages across the country and to
                have more black people participate in the discovery and
                development of new drugs to treat diseases, particularly those
                diseases that prey on the black community.
              </p>
              <p>
                "Ideally, I would like to see black people make the same kind of
                progress that women have made in participating in research
                affecting their own health. But it may take 50 years for a
                change like that to happen."
              </p>
              <p>
                In his quest to make his fledgling program fly, Allen has met
                with U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher, U.S. Secretary for
                Health and Human Services Donna Shalala and a host of other
                administrative policy makers and HIV researchers around the
                nation. He also has attended a number of national biomedical
                meetings, seeking support for the movement.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition, Allen has received a commitment from Roche
                Biosciences of Palo Alto, Calif., to donate laboratory chemicals
                to graduate school labs where young black researchers are
                learning the newest biomedical techniques. Allen noted that
                there already are a number of minority-based programs to
                encourage black people and other minorities to go into the
                biomedical sciences through scholarships and stipends.
              </p>
              <p>
                "The overall state of blacks' health is so poor, I believe we
                need a grand-scale program, not unlike the anti-tobacco or
                pro-environment campaigns, that will result in a new generation
                of black biomedical researchers to help create a more
                health-conscious black community," Allen said.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some progress was made in 1997 when President Clinton apologized
                to the black community for the Tuskegee experiments undertaken
                on black men by the U.S. Department of Health from the 1930s to
                the 1970s, Allen said. In response to a 1998 request by the
                Congressional Black Caucus for the government to declare a state
                of emergency for blacks and the AIDS epidemic, President Clinton
                recently tabbed $156 million for outreach programs to measure
                the impact of AIDS on black communities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Allen is taking his movement to the public one step at a time.
                In November 1998, he spoke to about 50 high school students at
                Montbello High School in Denver about his own life, his research
                and the goals of the Black Biomedical Research Movement.
              </p>
              <p>
                During his talk, Allen frequently encouraged the students to ask
                questions.
              </p>
              <p>
                "There is no such thing as stupid question," he told them. "You
                need to ask questions when you don't understand, and you need to
                be persistent. Keep your focus and remember one thing -
                knowledge is king."
              </p>
              <p>
                When Allen was five years old in Jamaica, his parents moved to
                New York, seeking a better life for their family. Allen stayed
                in Jamaica with his six siblings, living with an extended family
                of aunts, uncles and cousins for seven years.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the age of 12, he and his siblings moved to New York and were
                reunited with his father, who had become a machinist, and his
                mother, then a nurse's aid. But the culture shock of New York -
                where toughness and athletics were the primary avenues of
                popularity - made life difficult.
              </p>
              <p>"It was the hardest time of my life," he said.</p>
              <p>
                After Allen graduated from Springfield College, he went on to
                earn his doctorate from the University of California, Santa Cruz
                and received tenure track offers to teach at a number of
                universities. He chose to conduct research at CU-Boulder because
                of its international reputation for research on ribonucleic
                acid, or RNA, and its link to a number of viruses, including
                AIDS.

                The beauty, recreational opportunities and family ties in the
                Boulder area also played a part in his decision, said Allen, who
                regularly takes 40- to 50-mile fast, uphill rides on his
                mountain bike through the Front Range mountains as a way to
                challenge his own limits. He also is an avid skier and
                snowshoer.
              </p>
              <p>"I just like to be outdoors," he explained.</p>
              <p>
                In addition to his faculty position at CU-Boulder, Allen has
                served as a consultant to NexStar Pharmaceuticals, the Boulder
                biotech company that primarily targets AIDS and cancer.

                "I know I can't change the world," Allen said. "But I can try to
                change the way we promote biomedicine to black people that may
                stimulate black students to enter into biomedical research and
                the black community in general to reach out for medical help."
