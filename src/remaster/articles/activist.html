            Patrick Allen - an activist for black biomedical research
          </div>

            University of Colorado at Boulder Research Associate Patrick Allen
            continued the Chancellor's Community Lecture Series with his
            presentation "Scientist Turns Activist: The Black Biomedical
            Research Movement," Jan. 7.
          </p>
          <p>
            Allen has spent much of his 10-year career at CU-Boulder attempting
            to define the structure of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. He leads
            a team that has been awarded more than $1.2 million by the National
            Institutes of Health to search for inhibitors to target specific
            proteins.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Jamaica-born Allen has achieved renown not only in the area of
            AIDS research, but activism as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of Allen's biggest concerns is that although AIDS in the
            nation's black community has evolved into a full-blown epidemic,
            fewer than 1 percent of U.S. biomedical researchers are black.
          </p>
          <p>
            "When HIV first emerged around 1983, it was thought to be a disease
            that only affected homosexuals and hemophiliacs. It wasn't until
            1996 that I learned that blacks infected with HIV and AIDS
            outnumbered all other infected groups," Allen said.
          </p>
          <p>
            Allen has devoted his efforts to increase awareness about black
            health by educating and encouraging the black community to become
            more involved in its own healthcare. He has also initiated programs
            to encourage black high school students to pursue medical careers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Several years ago, Allen began to concentrate on spearheading a new
            organization called the Black Biomed-ical Research Movement designed
            to involve more blacks in biomedical research.
          </p>
          <p>
            "This is not about affirmative action, religion, politics or
            racism," Allen said. "In its simplest form, this is a scientific
            outreach program, with the black community being the primary target
            group."
          </p>
          <p>
            The ultimate goal of the organization is to promote black health
            consciousness among people of all ages nationwide, Allen said. With
            donations from private foundations, federal health institutes and
            nonprofit medical institutes, Allen plans to increase awareness
            through a series of fairs geared towards black health issues in
            major cities with large black populations, including New York City,
            Atlanta and Los Angeles.
          </p>
          <p>
            The disparity between the overall health of the black and white
            communities is caused in part by social, cultural and economic
            differences as well as a historical mistrust of the biomedical
            community, Allen said.
          </p>
          <p>
            "The fear and suspicion in the black community of the biomedical
            establishment is a major public health problem that reaches beyond
            disease," said Allen.
          </p>
          <p>
            His goal is to enlist famous role models, like black athletes and
            musicians, to address the black community about the importance of
            educating themselves about HIV, AIDS, hypertension, sickle-cell
            anemia and certain types of cancer that occur in high rates among
            black populations.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Ideally, I would like to see black people make the same kind of
            progress that women have made in participating in research affecting
            their own health," Allen said. "But it may take 50 years for a
            change like that to happen."
