            Dr Patrick Allen, a native of Jamaica-born in the Warika Hilis area
            off Windward Road, Kingston, holds a Undergraduate Degree from
            Springfield College B.S. in Biology and a Post-Graduate Degree from
            the University of California Santa Cruz, Ph.D. in Molecular Biology.
            Dr Allen is a professor and research associate at the University of
            Colorado at Boulder and is one of the country's leading AIDS/HIV
            researchers. Working since 1995 as principal investigator on a $1.2
            million National Institutes of Health study, Allen has been defining
            the HIV capsid structure (the region containing the viral genetic
            material) and searching for ways to inhibit the deadly virus. Dr
            Patrick Allen is the only black scientist funded by the National
            Institute of Allergic and Infectious Diseases (Division of AIDS) to
            do AIDS/HIV research. Yet, more blacks suffer from the disease than
            any other group in the U.S.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dr Allen founded the Black Biomedical Research Movement (BBRM) in
            order to increase the number of black researchers and to improve
            relations between the African American Community and the Biomedical
            field, thus heightening awareness and increasing the general level
            of consciousness on health issues within the black community. He
            promotes involvement in all aspects of biomedical research. The BBRM
            is a movement where health is the priority. He works with fellow
            scientists to encourage young African Americans to pursue research
            careers. Allen also organes a broad-based popular media awareness
            campaign and is pushing for legislative action that addresses these
            health issues.

          <p>
            HIV is just one of several health problems America's black community
            is vulnerable to. Other issues at the forefront include sickle cell
            anemia, hypertension, diabetes, prostate cancer, heart disease and
            infant mortality. The AIDS epidemic has hit an increasingly
            disproportionate number of blacks, but less than one percent of U.S.
            biomedical researchers are black. The most likely person to be
            infected today (in the United States) is a black woman 18-25 years
            old," Allen said. He and CU colleague Larry Gold hold a 1997 patent
            for creating specific RNA binding sites to inhibit HIV
          </p>
          <p>
            "With few black researchers and few black participants in drug
            research, there needs to be a cultural shift so the black community
            gets involved in biomedicine," Allen said. "A history of fear and
            suspicion in the black community toward the biomedical establishment
            is adding to a major public health problem. In the last 10 years,
            HIV has really affected the black community, and to not have any
            doing the research ... it definitely affects the work in the labs."
            Allen said "I'm trying to raise a black health-consciousness thing.
            You have to start somewhere, because if you don't, the legacy of
            health problems is just going to get worse. It's a disturbing legacy
            already. The annual HIV infection rate for black men is six times
            that for white men, while the rate for black women is 14 times that
            for white women, and 80% of the infants born with the HIV virus are
            Black," he said.
          </p>
          <p>
            The black community has historically distrusted the medical research
            com- munity. Most recently, the nation's attention was captured by
            details of the so-called Tuskegee experiments, which were conducted
            on black men with syphilis from 1932 to 1972. Those conducting the
            experiments deliberately withheld treatment from the men. But that's
            just one example of a national legacy of abusive research on black
            people. It has kept black people away from being researchers
            themselves, which in turn has created a sense of opposition. That
            separation is what Allen is trying to overcome. "There aren't a lot
            of blacks in science, but if there were more, you wouldn't have so
            much of a feeling of 'them against us," he said. The model Allen has
            in mind, is get- ting black people involved in Bio- medical Research
            and encouraging them to focus on health issues of par- ticular
            concern to blacks.
          </p>
          <p>
            He's contacted everyone from come- dian Chris Rock to U.S. Surgeon
            General David Satcher, trying to enlist them in a long-term battle
            to raise awareness in the black communi- ty, both to encourage new
            researchers and to get black people just to think about their
            health. "Black people def- initely know that blood sugar, blood
            pressure, various cancers, are big, big problems in the black
            community, but they're the least likely people to go to free health
            fairs," Allen pointed out. "You have to get them thinking like
            that." 'I want the nation to say this is important, and for black
            people to realize it," Allen said.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the present time Dr Patrick Allen is working on getting some
            funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) through the
            University of Colorado to write a grant to fund the training of all
            minority students from the 7th grade straight up to undergraduate
            and graduate school level in the field of Biomedical Research. He
            already has a commitment from Howard Hughes Medical Institute to
            match whatever funds are raised for grant money from the NIH.
          </p>
          <p>
            This year from June 15th- 17th at the Juneteenth Celebration in
            Denver, Colorado, the BBRM will be kicking off its first Health
            expo, a Black Health Symposium. There will be interactive stations
            each focusing on every health issue affecting the black community
            and the correlation between diet and health.
          </p>
          <h4>THE BLACK BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH MOVEMENT:</h4>
          <p>
            The specific objectives of the Black Biomedical Research Movement
            are to aggressively promote Black health consciousness and
            involvement in all facets of biomedical research. Our hope and
            ideals are essentially the same as those of the U.S. Department of
            Health and Human Services and the National Institutes of Health, in
            trying to reduce health disparity in minority populations and
            increase the pool of NIH funded minority scientists, respectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to the impressive list of ongoing traditional efforts at
            HHS and NIH that target these issues, BBRM will use very
            non-traditional approaches to show Black people that our health and
            longevity should be priority issues in our everyday lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, our disfranchisement from biomedical research is
            directly related to our poor health. Black people, in the United
            States, have a perilous legacy of health problems that continues to
            worsen with each generation.We suffer the brunt of all health
            disparities, yet we are least represented in every aspect of
            biomedicine.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1998, U.S. Congress made a historical request for a
            state-of-emergency because of the devastating impact of HIV/AIDS on
            the Black community in this country. President Clinton and Secretary
            Shalala declared a state-of-crisis, and federal funds were released
            to help relieve this crisis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Early in 1999, ABC Nightline reported on a study published in the
            New England Journal of Medicine that clearly demonstrates racial
            disparity in medical diagnosis. It suggested that our health care
            providers diagnose the same medical condition differently, based on
            race.
          </p>
          <p>
            Healthy People 2000/2010 is a federal initiative to eliminate health
            disparity in minority populations of the United States. How do we
            expect to eliminate health disparities when there is disparity in
            the way the system of medicine diagnoses our health problems? How
            can we eliminate health disparity with the deep-rooted fear,
            mistrust, suspicion and lack of confidence that the Black community
            holds for the biomedical research and health care system? How can we
            ever expect to eliminate health disparity in ten years when the
            disgraceful third- world infant mortality rate among america's black
            people remains persistent?
          </p>
          <p>
            We applaud all efforts aimed at improving the health of the black
            community and increasing involvement in biomedicine. We recognize
            their importance and realize that these efforts are crucially
            important for resolving these Black health problems. However, there
            is a serious and urgent need for a cohesive and coordinated Black
            health campaign. We need to be aware of Black health problems and
            learn how to identify and control them. Our religious leaders and
            political leaders and community leaders need to push Black health
            real hard. And especially our leaders in popular culture (Michael
            Jordan, Spike Lee, Chris Rock, Oprah Winfrey, Jay Z, Wu Tang Clan,
            DMX, Ziggy Marley, Culture, Bounty Killer, Capleton and others) need
            to push Black health to the fullest.
          </p>
          <p>
            Health has to become a priority for us, only then can betterment be
            expected. Our personal health should be the first thing we think
            about. We can live longer, healthier lives-Black people.
            Four-hundred years ago, when we were being brought here, we were
            strong, fit, healthy, vibrant people. (That is without mention of
            the stringent "survival of the fittest" screen that was inherent to
            the process; many failed to survive the treacherous journey from
            Africa). Today, we are among the sickest people in this country.
            This does not make me proud to be black. It does not matter if you
            are illiterate or Harvard educated; and it does not matter if you
            are poor and destitute or if rich and well-celebrated and you are on
            television every day; and it does not matter if you are Christian or
            Muslim or Democrat or Republican, in jail or on the streets, if you
            are Black, diabetes, sickle cell anemia, AIDS, hypertension, infant
            mortality, asthma, heart disease and certain types of cancer will
            always be our problem, know that.
