              <p><strong>By Ann Schrader</strong></p>
              <p>Denver Post Medical/Science Writer</p>
              <p>
                Patrick Allen is as passionate about raising awareness of health
                in the black community as he is about his research into the
                mysteries of HIV.
              </p>
              <p>
                "The black community really suffers from the brunt of a lot of
                health problems," the University of Colorado molecular biologist
                said Monday in talking with students at Denver's Montbello High
                School.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hypertension, sickle-cell anemia, certain can- cers and AIDS
                strike.inoro often among blacks than whites, said Allen, who has
                a $1.2 million Na- tional Institutes of Health grant to define
                HIV's structure and search for ways to inhibit the deadly virus.
              </p>
              <p>
                The AIDS epidemic has, bit an increasingly dis- proportionate
                share of blacks, but less than I per- cent of U.S. biomedical
                researchers are black, the CU research associate said.
              </p>
              <p>
                Colorado's latest figures show that nearly 16 percent of the
                state's HIV infections are among blacks. Among active AIDS cases
                throughout the epidemic, more than 10 percent of Colorado's
                cases have been black people.
              </p>
              <p>
                "The most likely person to be infected today (in the United
                States) is a black woman 18 to 25 years old," Allen said. Allen
                believes he is the only black molecular biologist with an NIH
                grant given to a principal investigator. He and CU colleague
                Larry Gold hold a 1997 patent for creating specific RNA binding
                sites to inhibit HIV.
              </p>
              <p>
                With few black researchers and few black participants in drug
                re- search, there needs to be a cultural shift so the black
                community gets involved in, biomedicine, Allen said. A history
                of fear and suspi- cion in the black community to- ward the
                biomedical establishment is adding to a major public health
                problem, he said.
              </p>
              <p>
                About two years ago, Allen be- gan the Black Biomedical Re-
                search Movement as a way to get more black people into research
                and experimental drug studies, and to raise the consciousness of
                policy makers.
              </p>
              <p>
                "It's important to get involved in the studies because
                researchers don't have access to certain types of people" such
                as blacks and women, Allen said.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Montbello students don't have to be molecular biologists "to
                support black health conscious- ness '" Allen said. "We need to
                do as much as we can in the next 30 to 40 years. The more we
                talk about it, the more it can make an impact on kids born now."
              </p>
              <p>
                Allen, an NCAA All-American wrestler before injuring a knee and
                refocusing his efforts on his educa. tion, urged the students
                not to be intimidated about asking questions of teachers.
              </p>
              <p>
                "It's a matter of asking questions and making it happen," he
                said. "Persistence. Focus. Take it one step at a time."
              </p>
              <p>
                Monday's presentation by Allen is the third CU outreach effort
                in Denver's secondary schools in the last year. Astrophysicist
                Larry Esposito and archaeologist Steve Lekson also have talked
                about their work and encouraged students to consider entering
                scientific fields.
