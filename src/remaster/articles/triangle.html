                Passionate and Articulate About the Need for Change, Allen is
                Also an Excellent Role Model
              </p>
              <p><strong>Janet Barrett</strong></p>
              <p>Office of Marketing and Communications</p>
              <p>
                Scientist Patrick Allen '84 is on a dual mission-to probe the
                complexities of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and to
                increase awareness in the black community about the need to
                become involved in biomedical research.
              </p>
              <p>
                A professor of research at the University of Colorado at
                Boulder, Dr. Allen heads his own laboratory, funded by a major
                grant from the National Institute of Allergic and Infectious
                Diseases of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). To the best
                of his knowledge, he is the only black molecular biologist with
                an RO-1 rating in HIV research - RO-1 grants being those given
                to principal investigators.
              </p>
              <p>
                The uniqueness of his position has set Allen on a long-range
                course of action - to increase the number of blacks in
                biomedical research and thereby focus attention on the
                development of drugs and vaccines that will benefit the black
                population.
              </p>
              <p>
                "I want people to understand that involvement in this field,
                both as researchers and as subjects in drug research, is very
                important for the health of the black community," he says. He
                feels that such involvement will have an effect similar to that
                of the growing number of women in science, which has resulted in
                more attention being paid to female-related health problems.
              </p>
              <p>
                Allen's position as one of several top scientists in HIV
                research at the University of Colorado gives him the leverage to
                reach major black government, entertainment, and sports figures
                to begin to solve what he acknowledges is a complex problem.
              </p>
              <p>
                "There are so few blacks in science because they are distrustful
                of it - and their suspicion is due to the fact that the people
                in the field aren't black," he notes. "At the same time, across
                the board, black people are the most affected by infectious
                diseases, including ones that are specific to them@ like sickle
                cell anemia, or prevalent among them, such as allergic asthma
                and hypertension."
              </p>
              <p>
                Passionate and articulate about the need for change, Allen is
                also an excellent role model. A native of Jamaica, West Indies,
                he came to Westchester County, New York, at the start of seventh
                grade. When it came time to attend college, he chose Springfield
                because of its smallness and because "everyone said 'hello'."
                Though a biology major, he admits to being "more into wrestling
                than anything else at the time"-not surprising for an
                All-American with his sights set on the 1984 Olympics.
                Meanwhile, as a junior, Allen interned at Memorial
                Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, where he worked on
                blood research in a leukemia lab. That experience came during
                the year that HIV began getting attention.
              </p>
              <p>
                A year later, a knee injury dashed his hopes for the Olympics
                and he opted for graduate school. At the University of
                California at Santa Cruz, the emphasis on technical training
                provided a perfect complement to the academic grounding Allen
                had received at Springfield College. With his graduate work
                focused on nucteic acids and proteins-the same components of the
                HIV virusAllen's future course was virtually set. After earning
                his Ph.D. in molecular biology in 1991, he joined the faculty of
                the University of Colorado. In addition to his NIH funding,
                Allen holds a Jane Coffin Childs Fellowship, a post-doctoral
                cancer grant out of Yale University.
              </p>
              <p>
                Allen is hoping to organize mentorships between his colleagues
                and black students entering the field. He likens his campaign to
                the long-range drive to change attitudes about cigarette
                smoking: "We have to make health and biomedical research
                priority issues, and find ways to reach everyone in the black
                community. I'm thinking thirty years. It's going to take a lot
                of time and effort."
